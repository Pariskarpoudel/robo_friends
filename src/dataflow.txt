we only have unidirectional dataflow
app is parent and cardlist and searchbox are child components
to communicate between two siblings, we use their common ancestry or parent
so directly milena, so first i will pass the info of searchfield to  app(PASS DATA FROM CHILD TO PARENT) , then pass that data from  app to cardlist via props (PASS DATA FROM PARENT TO CHILD)

1) PASSING DATA FROM PARENT TO CHILD
= Through props

2) PASSING DATA FROM CHILD TO PARENT (use of callback and props) (searchbox to app)
= First, we have to pass a method of parent component(class) to child component as props as callback
Then , that method/function will be triggered due to some events like onclick,onchange, so  khasma ta yo func parentma defined xa so parent component ma jo call hunivayo and its output will be accessible in the parent component which now will be passed to another sibling as props
so we passed info from child component to parent component in this way
